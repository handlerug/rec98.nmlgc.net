	So, TH05 <code>OP.EXE</code>. The first half of this push started out
	nicely, with an easy decompilation of the entire player character
	selection menu. Typical ZUN quality, with not much to say about it. While
	the overall function structure is identical to its TH04 counterpart, the
	two games only really share small snippets inside these functions, and do
	need to be RE'd separately.
</p><p>
	The high score viewing (not registration) menu would have been next.
	Unfortunately, it calls one of the <code>GENSOU.SCR</code> loading
	functions‚Ä¶ which are all a complete mess that still needed to be sorted
	out first. 5 distinct functions in 6 binaries, and of course TH05 also
	micro-optimized its <code>MAIN.EXE</code> version to directly use the DOS
	<code>INT 21h</code> file loading API instead of master.lib's wrappers.
	Could have all been avoided with a single method on the score data
	structure, taking a player character ID and a difficulty level as
	parameters‚Ä¶
</p><p>
	So, no score menu in this push then. Looking at the other end of the ASM
	code though, we find the starting functions for the main game, the Extra
	Stage, and the demo replays, which <i>did</i> fit perfectly to round out
	this push.
</p><p>
	Which is where we find an easter egg! ü•ö If you've ever looked into
	<code>ÊÄ™Á∂∫Ë´á2.DAT</code>, you might have noticed 6 <code>.REC</code> files
	with replays for the Demo Play mode. However, the game only ever seems to
	cycle between 4 replays. So what's in the other two, and why are they
	40&nbsp;KB instead of just 10&nbsp;KB like the others? Turns out that they
	combine into a full Extra Stage Clear replay with Mima, with 3 bombs and 1
	death, obviously recorded by ZUN himself. The split into two files for the
	stage (<code>DEMO4.REC</code>) and boss (<code>DEMO5.REC</code>) portion is
	merely an attempt to limit the amount of simultaneously allocated heap
	memory.<br />
	To watch this replay without modding the game, unlock the Extra Stage with
	all 4 characters, then hold both the ‚¨ÖÔ∏è left and ‚û°Ô∏è right arrow keys in the
	main menu while waiting for the usual demo replay.
	I can't possibly be the first one to discover this, but I couldn't find
	any other mention of it.<br />
	<strong>Edit (2021-03-15):</strong> ZUN did in fact document this replay
	in Section 6 of TH05's <code>OMAKE.TXT</code>, along with the exact method
	to view it.

	Here's a recording of the whole replay:

</figure><p>
	Note how the boss dialogue is skipped. <code>MAIN.EXE</code> actually
	contains no less than 6 <code>if()</code> branches just to distinguish
	this overly long replay from the regular ones.
</p><hr /><p>
	I'd really like to do the TH04 and TH05 main menus in parallel, since we
	can expect a bit more shared code after all the initial differences.
	Therefore, I'm going to put the next "anything" push towards covering the
	TH04 version of those functions. Next up though, it's back to TH01, with
	more redundant image format code‚Ä¶
