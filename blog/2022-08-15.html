	On August 15, 1997, at Comiket 52, an unknown doujin developer going by the
	name of ZUN released his first game, <cite><span lang="ja">Êù±ÊñπÈùàÁï∞‰ºù„ÄÄÔΩû
	</span> The Highly Responsive to Prayers</cite>, marking the start of the
	Touhou Project game series that keeps running to this day. Today, exactly 25
	years later, the C++ source code to version 1.10 of that game has been
	completely and perfectly reconstructed, reviewed, and documented.

	And with that, a warm welcome to all game journalists who have
	(re-)discovered this project through these news! Here's a summary for
	everyone who doesn't want to go through 3 years worth of blog posts:
</p><h5>What does this mean?</h5><ul>
	<li>All code that ZUN wrote as part of a TH01 installation has now been
	decompiled to C++ code. The only parts left in assembly are two third-party
	libraries (master.lib and PiLoad), which were originally written in
	assembly, and are built from their respective official source code.</li>
	<li>You can clone the <a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98">ReC98
	repository</a>, set up the build environment, and get a binary with an
	identical program image. The hashes of the resulting executables won't match
	those of ZUN's original release, but all differences there stem from details
	in the .EXE header that don't influence program execution, such as the
	on-disk order of the conceptually unordered set of x86 memory segment
	relocations. If you're interested in that level of correctness, you can
	order <i>Easier verification against original binaries</i> from the store.
	For now though, use <a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/mzdiff">mzdiff</a> for
	verifying the builds against ZUN's binaries.</li>
	<li>Ever since this crowdfunding has started 3 years ago, the goal of this
	project has shifted more and more towards a full-on code review rather than
	being just a mechanical decompilation:<ul>
		<li>Hardcoded constants were derived from as few truly hardcoded values
		as possible, which uncovered their intended meaning and highlighted any
		inconsistencies</li>
		<li>Code was deduplicated to a perhaps obsessive level (I'm still trying
		to find a balance)</li>
		<li>Tons of comments everywhere to put everything into context</li>
		<li>And, of course, <a href="/blog/tag/th01">2¬Ω years worth of blog
		posts</a> summarizing any highlights, glitches, and secrets. (There
		might still be some left to be discovered!)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>As a result, modding the games and porting them away from the PC-98
	platform is now a lot easier.</li>
</ul><h5>What does this not mean?</h5><ul>
	<li>This is not a piracy release. ReC98 only provides the code that the
	game's .EXE and .COM files are built out of. Without the rest of the
	original data files, supplied from a pre-existing game copy, the code won't
	do very much.</li>
	<li>Even apart from ZUN's own code quality, the ReC98 repository is not as
	polished and consistent as it could be, having seen multiple code structure
	evolutions over the 8 years of its existence.</li>
	<li>TH01 hasn't magically reached Doom levels of easy portability now. As a
	decompilation of the exact code that ZUN wrote for the PC-98 platform, it is
	<i>very</i> PC-98-native, and wildly mixes game logic with hardware
	accesses. As ZUN's first foray into game development, he understandably
	didn't see the need for writing an engine or hardware abstraction layer
	yet.</li>
</ul><p>
	So while this milestone opened the floodgates to PC-98-native mods, I
	wouldn't advise trying to attempt a port away from PC-98 right now. But then
	again, I have a financial interest in being a part of the porting process,
	and who knows, maybe you <i>can</i> just merge in a PC-98 emulator core and
	get started with something halfway decent in a short amount of time. After
	all, TH01 is by far the easiest PC-98 Touhou game to port to other systems,
	as it makes the least use of hardware features.
</p><p>
	However, this game in particular raises the question of what <i>exactly</i>
	one would even <i>want</i> to port. TH01 is a broken flicker-fest that
	overwhelmingly suffers the drawbacks of PC-98 hardware rather than using it
	to its advantage. Out of the 78 bugs that I ended up labeling as such, the
	majority are <a href="/blog/tag/th01/blitting">sprite blitting issues</a>,
	while you can  <a href="/blog/tag/th01/good-code">count the instances of
	good hardware use on one hand</a>.<br />
	And even at the level of game logic, this game features a <i>lot</i> of
	weird, inconsistent behavior. Less rigorous projects such as <a
	href="https://github.com/Wintiger0222/uth05win">uth05win</a> would probably
	promptly identify these issues as bugs and fix them. On the one hand, this
	shows that there is a part of the community that wants sane versions of
	these games which behave as expected. In other parts of the community
	though, such projects quickly gain the reputation of being too inaccurate to
	bother about them.
</p><p>
	Some terminology might help here. If you look over the ReC98 codebase,
	you'll find that I classified any weird code into three categories:
</p><ul>
	<li id="zun-bug"><a href="#zun-bug">üîó <strong>ZUN bugs</strong></a>: Broken
	code that results from logic errors or incorrect programming
	language/API/hardware use, with enough evidence in the code to indicate that
	ZUN did not intend the bug. Fixing these issues must not affect hypothetical
	replay compatibility, and any resulting visual changes must match ZUN's
	provable intentions.</li>
	<li id="zun-quirk"><a href="#zun-quirk">üîó <strong>ZUN quirks</strong></a>:
	Weird code that looks incorrect in context. Fixing these issues would change
	gameplay enough to desync a hypothetical replay recorded on the original
	version, or affect the visuals so much that the result is no longer faithful
	to ZUN's original release. It might very well be called a fangame at that
	point.</li>
	<li id="zun-bloat"><a href="#zun-bloat">üîó <strong>ZUN bloat</strong></a>:
	Code that wastes memory, CPU cycles, or even just the mental capacity of
	anyone trying to read and understand the code. If you want to write a
	particularly resource-intensive mod, these are the places you could claim
	some of those resources from.</li>
</ul><p>
	Some examples:
</p><ul>
	<li>All crashes are bugs</li>
	<li>All blitting issues related to inappropriate VRAM byte alignment are
	bugs</li>
	<li>All the {{Blog_PostLink "2022-08-08" "incorrect coordinate calculations in the YuugenMagan fight"}} are quirks</li>
	<li>The overly high damage of TH10's MarisaB 3.00-3.95 power shot is a
	quirk, <a href="https://nylilsa.github.io/#/bugs/th10/0">despite having been
	proven to be a typo</a>.</li>
	<li>The idea of splitting TH01 across three executables is its biggest
	source of bloat. It wastes disk space, the game doesn't even make use of the
	memory gained from unloading unneeded code and data, it complicates the
	build process and code structure with inconsistencies between the individual
	binaries, and the required inter-process communication via shared memory
	adds another piece of global state mutation headache.</li>
</ul><p>
	Since I'm not in the business of writing fanfiction, I won't offer any
	option that fixes <i>quirks</i>. That's where all of you can come in, and
	use ReC98 as a base for remasters and remakes. As for bloat and bugs though,
	there are many ways we could go from here:
</p><ul>
	<li>If you want to ultimately try porting the game yourself, but still
	support ReC98 somehow, I can recommend the <i>ZUN code cleanup</i> goal.
	This is the most conservative option that leaves all bugs and quirks in
	place and only removes <i>bloat</i>, rearchitecting the codebase so that
	it's easier to work with.</li>
	<li>For an improved gameplay experience on PC-98, choose the <i>TH01
	Anniversary Edition</i> goal. In addition to the above code cleanup, this
	goal fixes every <i>bug</i> with the game, most notably all the sprite
	flickering by implementing a completely new renderer, while maintaining
	hypothetical replay compatibility to ZUN's original release.</li>
	<li>If you're mainly interested in seeing any variety of TH01 ported away
	from PC-98 to any system, choose the <i>Portability to non-PC-98 systems</i>
	goal. In this one, I'm going to develop the abstraction layers that would
	ultimately bring this game to the aforementioned Doom level of portability,
	while still keeping it running with better than original performance on
	PC-98.</li>
	<li><i>Replay support</i> is also something you could order‚Ä¶</li>
	<li>‚Ä¶ as is <i>Multilingual translation support (on PC-98)</i>, for those
	sweet non-ASCII characters if that's your thing.</li>
</ul><p>
	Then again, with all these choices in mind, maybe we should just let TH01 be
	what it is: ZUN's first game, evidence for the truth that no programmer
	writes good code the first time around, and more of a historical curiosity
	than anything you'd want to maintain and modernize. The idea of moving on to
	the next game and decompiling all 5 PC-98 Touhou games in order has
	certainly <a
	href="https://twitter.com/TheArandui/status/1549480991806324736">shown to be
	popular among the backers who funded this 100% goal</a>.
</p><hr /><p>
	Since the beginning of the year, I've been dramatically raising the level of
	quality and care I've been putting into this project, leading to 9 of the 10
	longest blog posts having been written in the past 8 months. The community
	reception has been even more supportive as well, with all of you still
	regularly selling out the store in return. To match the level of quality
	with the community demand, I'm raising push prices from
	{{HTML_Currency 6000}} to {{HTML_Currency 7500}} per push, as of this blog
	post. {{Blog_PostLink "2021-12-01" "As usual"}}, I'm going to deliver any
	existing orders in the backlog at the value they were originally purchased
	at. Due to the way the cap has to be calculated, these contributions now
	appear to have increased in value by 25%.
</p><p>
	However, I do realize that this might make regular pushes prohibitively
	expensive for some. This could especially prevent all these exciting modding
	goals from ever getting off the ground. Thinking about it though, the push
	system is only really necessary for the core reverse-engineering business,
	where longer, concentrated stretches of work allow me to study a new piece
	of code in a larger context and improve the quality of the final result. In
	contrast, modding-related goals could theoretically be segmented into
	arbitrarily small portions of work, as I have a clear idea of where I want
	to go and how to get there.<br />
	Thus, I'm introducing <i>microtransactions</i>, now available for all
	modding-related goals. These allow you to order fractional pieces of work
	for as low as 1 ‚Ç¨, which I will immediately deliver without requiring others
	to fund a full push first. <strong>Edit (2022-08-16):</strong> And then the
	store still sold out with a single regular contribution by
	{{DB_CustomerByID 17}} towards more reverse-engineering. Guess that this
	experiment will have to wait a little while longer, then‚Ä¶ üòÖ
</p><p>
	Next up: Taking a break and recovering from crunch time by improving video
	playback on this blog and <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues">working on Shuusou Gyoku</a>,
	before returning to Touhou in September.
