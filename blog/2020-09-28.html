	Back to TH01, and its boss sprite formatâ€¦ with a separate class for
	storing animations that only differs minutely from the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-08-12" "regular boss entity class I covered last time"}}?
	Decompiling this class was almost free, and the main reason why the first
	of these pushes ended up looking pretty huge.
</p><p>
	Next up were the remaining shape drawing functions from the code segment
	that started with the .GRC functions. P0105 already started these with the
	(surprisingly sanely implemented) 8Ã—8 diamond, star, andâ€¦ uh, snowflake
	(?) sprites
	<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAIAQMAAADZb60gAAAABlBMVEUAAH4AAAAuh25gAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAACZJREFUeAEFwTEBACAAw7DKmJhdyEAAMma9JCShLfOi4mS79JWcfK+gCvOAwD5hAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" alt="" />,
	prominently seen in the Konngara, Elis, and Sariel fights, respectively.
	Now, we've also got:
</p><ul>
	<li>ellipse arcs with a customizable angle distance between the individual
	dots â€“ mostly just used for drawing full circles, though</li>
	<li>line loops â€“ which are only used for the rotating white squares around
	Mima, meaning that the white star in the YuugenMagan fight got a completely
	redundant reimplementation</li>
	<li>and the surprisingly weirdest one, drawing the red invincibility
	sprites.</li>
</ul><p>
	The weirdness becomes obvious with just a single screenshot:
</p><figure><a
	href="{{$pic}}"><img src="{{$pic}}" alt="TH01 invincibility sprite weirdness" /></a></figure
><p>
	First, we've got the obvious issue of the sprites not being clipped at the
	right edge of VRAM, with the rightmost pixels in each row of the sprite
	extending to the beginning of the next row. Well, that's just what you get
	if you insist on writing unique low-level blitting code for the majority
	of the individual sprites in the gameâ€¦ ðŸ¤·<br />
	More importantly though, the sprite sheet looks like this:
	<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACAAAAAIAQMAAACiS2/sAAAABlBMVEUAAKUAAADf0lD4AAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAACBJREFUeF5jYGCQkABhHQYJHZ0oBp26//8hBJgLlgCRAJs0B/0NobvEAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" alt="" />
	So how do we even get these fully filled red diamonds?
</p><p>
	Well, turns out that the sprites are never consistently unblitted during
	their 8 frames of animation. There <i>is</i> a function that <i>looks</i>
	like it unblits the spriteâ€¦ except that it starts with by enabling the
	GRCG andâ€¦ <i>reading</i> from the first bitplane on the background page?
	If this was the EGC, such a read would fill some internal registers with
	the contents of all 4 bitplanes, which can then subsequently be blitted to
	all 4 bitplanes of any VRAM page with a single memory write. But with the
	GRCG in RMW mode, reads do nothing special, and simply copy the memory
	contents of one bitplane to the read destination. <i>Maybe</i> ZUN thought
	that setting the RMW color to <span style="color: #ff0000;">red</span>
	also sets some internal 4-plane mask register to match that color?
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} <br />
	Instead, the rather random pixels read from the first bitplane are then
	used as a mask for a <i>second</i> blit of the same red sprite.
	Effectively, this only really "unblits" the invincibility pixels that are
	drawn on top of Reimu's sprite. Since Reimu is drawn first, the
	invincibility sprites are overwritten anyway. But due to the palette color
	layout of Reimu's sprite, its pixels end up fully masking away any
	invincibility sprite pixels in that second blit, leaving VRAM untouched as
	a result. Anywhere else though, this animation quickly turns into the
	union of all animation frames.
</p><p>
	Then again, if that 16-dot-aligned rectangular unblitting function is all
	you know about the EGC, and you can't be bothered to write a perfect
	unblitter for 8Ã—8 sprites, it becomes obvious why you wouldn't want to use
	it:
</p><figure>{{$vid.Tag}}</figure><p>
	Because Reimu would barely be visible under all that flicker. In
	comparison, those fully filled diamonds actually look pretty good.
</p><hr /><p>
	After all that, the remaining time wouldn't have been enough for the next
	few essential classes, so I closed out the push with three more VRAM
	effects instead:
</p><ul>
	<li>Single-bitplane pixel inversion inside a 32Ã—32 square â€“ the main effect
	behind the discoloration seen in the bomb animation, as well as the
	expanding squares at the end of Kikuri's and Sariel's entrance
	animation</li>
	<li>EGC-accelerated VRAM row copies â€“ the second half of smooth and fully
	hardware-accelerated scrolling for backgrounds that are twice the size of
	VRAM</li>
	<li>And finally, the VRAM page content transition function using meshed 8Ã—8
	squares, used for the blocky transition to Sariel's first and second phases.
	Which is quite ridiculous in just how needlessly bloated it is. I'm positive
	that this sort of thing could have also been accelerated using the PC-98's
	EGCâ€¦ although simply writing better C would have already gone a long way.
	The function also comes with three unused mesh patterns.</li>
</ul><hr /><p>
	And with that, ReC98, as a whole, is not only â…“ done, but I've also fully
	caught up with the feature backlog for the first time in the history of
	this crowdfunding! Time to go into maintenance mode then, while we wait
	for the next pushes to be funded. Got a huge backlog of tiny maintenance
	issues to address at a leisurely pace, and of course there's also the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-03" "16-bit build system"}} waiting to be
	finished.
