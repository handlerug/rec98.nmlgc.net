<p>
	Only one newly ordered push since I've reopened the store? Great, that's
	all the justification I needed for the extended maintenance delay that was
	part of these two pushes ðŸ˜›
</p><p>
	Having to write comments to explain whether coordinates are relative to
	the top-left corner of the screen or the top-left corner of the playfield
	has finally become old. So, I introduced
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/e447a2d6879fdc9010848de5594acbaf17cb0c16/pc98.h#L5">distinct
	types for all the coordinate systems we typically encounter</a>, applying
	them to all code decompiled so far. Note how the planar nature of PC-98
	VRAM meant that X and Y coordinates also had to be different from each
	other. On the X side, there's mainly the distinction between the
	[0;&nbsp;640] screen space and the corresponding [0;&nbsp;80] VRAM byte
	space. On the Y side, we also have the [0;&nbsp;400] screen space, but
	the visible area of VRAM might be limited to [0;&nbsp;200] when running in
	the PC-98's line-doubled 640Ã—200 mode. A VRAM Y coordinate also always
	implies an added offset for vertical scrolling.
	<br />
	During all of the code reconstruction, these types can only have a
	documenting purpose. Turning them into anything more than just
	<code>typedef</code>s to <code>int</code>, in order to define conversion
	operators between them, simply won't recompile into identical binaries.
	Modding and porting projects, however, now have a nice foundation for
	doing just that, and can entirely lift coordinate system transformations
	into the type system, without having to proofread all the meaningless
	<code>int</code> declarations themselves.
</p><hr /><p>
	So, what was left in terms of memory references? EX-Alice's fire waves
	were our final unknown entity that can collide with the player. Decently
	implemented, with little to say about them.
</p><p>
	That left the bomb animation structures as the one big remaining PI
	blocker. They started out nice and simple in TH04, with a small 6-byte
	star animation structure used for both Reimu and Marisa. TH05, however,
	gave each character her own animationâ€¦ and <i>what the hell</i> is going
	on with Reimu's blue stars there? Nope, not going to figure this out on
	ASM level.
</p><p>
	A decompilation first required some more bomb-related variables to be
	named though. Since this was part of a generic RE push, it made sense to
	do this in all 5 gamesâ€¦ which then led to nice PI gains in anything
	<i>but</i> TH05. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} Most notably, we now got the
	<i>"pulling all items to player"</i> flag in TH04 and TH05, which is
	actually separate from bombing. The obvious cheat mod is left as an
	exercise to the reader.
</p><hr /><p>
	So, TH05 bomb animations. Just like the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-02-29" "custom entity types of this game"}}, all 4
	characters share the same memory, with the superficially same 10-byte
	structure.<br />
	But let's just look at the very first field. Seen from a low level, it's a
	simple <code>struct { int x, y; } pos</code>, storing the current position
	of the character-specific bomb animation entity. But all 4 characters use
	this field differently:
</p><ul>
	<li>For Reimu's blue stars, it's the top-left position of each star, in the
	12.4 fixed-point format. But unlike the vast majority of these values in
	TH04 and TH05, it's relative to the top-left corner of the
	<i>screen</i>, not the playfield. Much better represented as
	<code>struct { Subpixel screen_x, screen_y; } topleft</code>.</li>
	<li>For Marisa's lasers, it's the center of each circle, as a regular 12.4
	fixed-point coordinate, relative to the top-left corner of the playfield.
	Much better represented as
	<code>struct { Subpixel x, y; } center</code>.</li>
	<li>For Mima's shrinking circles, it's the center of each circle in regular
	pixel coordinates. Much better represented as
	<code>struct { screen_x_t x; screen_y_t y; } center</code>.</li>
	<li>For Yuuka's spinning heart, it's the top-left corner in regular pixel
	coordinates. Much better represented as
	<code>struct { screen_x_t x; screen_y_t y; } topleft</code>.<br />
	And yes, singular. The game is actually smart enough to only store a single
	heart, and then create the rest of the circle on the fly. (If it were even
	smarter, it wouldn't even use this structure member, but oh well.)</li>
</ul><p>
	Therefore, I decompiled it as 4 separate structures once again, bundled
	into an <code>union</code> of arrays.
</p><p>
	As for Reimuâ€¦ yup, that's some pointer arithmetic straight out of
	<span
		class="hovertext"
		title="(TL note: Jigoku means hell.)"
	>Jigoku*</span> for setting and updating the positions of the falling star
	trails. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} While that certainly required several
	comments to wrap my head around the current array positions, the one "bug"
	in all this arithmetic luckily has no effect on the game.<br />
	There <i>is</i> a small glitch with the growing circles, though. They are
	spawned at the end of the loop, with their position taken from the star
	pointerâ€¦ but <i>after</i> that pointer has already been incremented. On
	the last loop iteration, this leads to an out-of-bounds structure access,
	with the position taken from some unknown EX-Alice data, which is 0 during
	most of the game. If you look at the animation, you can easily spot these
	bugged circles, consistently growing from the top-left corner (0,&nbsp;0)
	of the playfield:
</p><figure>{{$vid.Tag}}</figure><hr /><p>
	After all that, there was barely enough remaining time to filter out and
	label the final few memory references. But now, TH05's
	<code>MAIN.EXE</code> is <i>technically</i> position-independent! ðŸŽ‰
	{{DB_CustomerByID 2}} is going to work on a pretty extensive demo of this
	unprecedented level of efficient Touhou game modding. For a more impactful
	effect of both the 100% PI mark and that demo, I'll be delaying the push
	covering the remaining false positives in that binary until that demo is
	done. I've accumulated a pretty huge backlog of minor maintenance issues
	by nowâ€¦<br />
	Next up though: The first part of the long-awaited build system
	improvements. I've finally come up with a way of sanely accelerating the
	32-bit build part on most setups you could possibly want to build ReC98
	on, without making the building experience worse for the other few setups.
